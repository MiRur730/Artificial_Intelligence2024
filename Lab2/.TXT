right ka logic would be
(self.empty_tile + 1) % 3 != 0: This expression calculates the column index of the empty tile
 after moving it to the right. If the remainder of dividing
  the new column index by 3 is not equal to 0,
   it means the new position is not at the right edge of the grid, so the move is valid.

Performing the Move: If the move is valid, the method calculates the
 index of the new position of the empty tile after moving it to the right:

new_empty_index = self.empty_tile + 1

Then, it calls the move_empty_tile helper method, passing the index of the new empty tile position. This method returns a new state of the puzzle with the tiles swapped, effectively representing the state after making the move.

Returning the New State: If the move is valid, the
 method returns the new state of the puzzle after moving
  the empty tile to the right. If the move is not valid
   (i.e., the empty tile is already at the right edge of the grid), it returns None to indicate that no move was made.



   down

   self.empty_tile + 3 < 9: This expression calculates the index of 
   the cell below the empty tile and checks if it's within the range of valid indices
    (0 to 8 for a 3x3 grid). If the new index is less than 9, it means the move is valid.

Looping through the Puzzle Cells: The method iterates over a range of integers from 0 to 8 using the range(9) function. This represents all the possible indices in a 3x3 grid (or any similar grid represented by a 1D list).

Checking for the Empty Tile: For each index i in the loop, it checks if the value of the cell at that index in the current_state list is equal to 0, indicating that it's the empty tile.    





logic to move the tileCopying the Current State:

new_state = self.current_state[:]: This line creates a copy of the current state of the puzzle (self.current_state) using Python's slicing notation. This ensures that modifications made to new_state do not affect the original self.current_state.
Swapping Tiles:

new_state[self.empty_tile], new_state[new_empty_index] = new_state[new_empty_index], new_state[self.empty_tile]: This line swaps the positions of the empty tile and the tile to be moved within new_state.
new_state[self.empty_tile] represents the value of the empty tile in new_state.
new_state[new_empty_index] represents the value of the tile at the index specified by new_empty_index.
By swapping these values, the positions of the empty tile and the tile to be moved are effectively exchanged in new_state.
Returning the Updated State:

return new_state: After performing the swap, the method returns the updated state of the puzzle (new_state) to the caller.
This updated state reflects the result of moving the empty tile to the position specified by new_empty_index.
